# Hangman

Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

## Description

The aim of this project is to provide a digital version of the traditional Hangman game. This implementation provides a platform for users to play against the computer. Throughout the development of this project, I learned about handling user input, implementing game logic, and creating an interactive command-line interface.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository-link>`.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the game using `cd hangman`.
3. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. If not, download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/).

## Usage

1. Run the game by executing `python [TO-DO].py` in the command line.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game. You will be prompted to guess letters until you either guess the word or run out of attempts.
